# numbers-app

I chose Option One and combined projects week13 and week15 together. There are two different apps stored inside of this new main one that are accessible via the home screen and side drawer.

The first new component is a single page timer that starts the moment you click on the page. It uses a dispatch to allow you to stop, start, and reset the timer. This was made around two weeks ago is completely independent of all past timer mechanics used in the class.

The second new component is a calculator that takes in two numbers with TextInput and pushes out a value based on the function type you select from a picker. I used RNPickerSelect for this. 

The third component is an About Me that contains a toggle, allowing me to change the color theme of the page and content with just the click of a button.
