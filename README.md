# numbers-app

I chose Option One and combined projects week13 and week15 together. There are two different apps stored inside of this new main one that are accessible via the home screen and side drawer. 

The first new component is a single page timer that starts the moment you click on the page. It uses a dispatch to allow you to top, start, and reset the timer. This was made during the week15 assignment, and is completely independent of all past timer mechanics used in the class.
